# Nicusor Dan's Upset Victory in Romania's Presidential Election

## The Claim
He won a presidential election against Simion.

## Rephrased Claim
Election results featuring Simion and an unnamed presidential winner.

## Agent Reasoning (step by step)
1. Evaluate the first-round election results, where Simion led with 40.96% of the votes.
2. Analyze the second-round election results, which showed Dan winning around 53.6% of the vote compared to Simion's 46%.
3. Compare the increase in votes for both candidates between the first and second rounds.

## Inaccuracy Score (0 = Completely False, 100 = Clearly Accurate)
**Score:** 90

**Explanation:**
The claim is largely accurate, as Nicusor Dan did win the presidential election against Simion. However, there were discrepancies in the vote count between the first and second rounds. While Dan's votes increased significantly (32% more), Simion's increase was relatively minor (6%). This suggests that while Dan won, it was not an overwhelming victory.
