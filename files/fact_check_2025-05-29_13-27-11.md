# Trump's Emergency Law for Tariffs Faces Major Legal Hurdle

## The Claim
Judges ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority when using an emergency law to impose tariffs.

## Rephrased Claim
"US court ruling on President Trump's use of emergency law for tariffs imposition."

## Agent Reasoning (step by step)
1. Evaluate the lawsuit filed against President Trump's tariffs.
2. Determine if the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) was correctly applied.
3. Assess whether the judges' decision aligns with the arguments presented in the lawsuit.

## Inaccuracy Score (0 = Completely False, 100 = Clearly Accurate)
**Score:** 90

**Explanation:**
The evidence suggests that the US court is considering a lawsuit challenging President Trump's use of an emergency law to impose tariffs. The plaintiffs argue that IEEPA does not give the president the power to issue sweeping duties, and that trade deficits are not an emergency. The Department of Justice argues that IEEPA authorizes the president to impose tariffs under specified circumstances.
